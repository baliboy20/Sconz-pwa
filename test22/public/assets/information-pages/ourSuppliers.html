  <h2> Our Suppliers
  </h2>
  <p> Ultimately Rosslyn is a place where we bring together those who we believe to be leaders across various fields and
    represent their outstanding work under one roof.
  </p>
  <h2> Origin Coffee Roasters
  </h2>

  <p> We are incredibly proud to collaborate with one of the leading roasteries in the industry to bring you some of the
    best coffees from around the world. Tom and the entire team at Origin have firmly established a place amongst some
    of the best in the business and have become an integral part of what we do at Rosslyn. More than anyone they are
    responsible for the coffee you find in your cup!ozone
  </p>
  <h2> Mörk Chocolate
  </h2>
  <p> Josefin and Kiril have been close friends of ours since our time in Melbourne. We worked with them to help Mörk
    launch in the UK and believe this is the best hot chocolate that we have ever tasted. 50% cacao from Peru and 50%
    coconut blossom sugar from Indonesia provide an exceptional cup which can be found in numerous Michelin starred
    restaurants around the world.
  </p>


  <h2> Melisa Dora Ceramics
  </h2>
  <p> Supporting local is very important to us and we are extremely proud of our relationship with the talented Melisa
    Dora who handmakes our ceramics in Honor Oak Park, in the south eastern reaches of London.
  </p>



  <h2> The Estate Dairy Milk
  </h2>
  <p> Rebecca and Shaun have been good friends of ours long before both of our respective businesses were established.
    We believe this is the best milk to complement our coffee and are very grateful to be able to bring to you the work
    that they do in Somerset.
  </p>

  <h2> Canton Tea
  </h2>
  <p> It’s not all about the coffee at Rosslyn and we are extremely proud of our relationship with Canton Tea which
    allows us to offer you some outstanding teas. Upon our first meeting with Jennifer and her team, we knew we had
    found a supplier who shared our values for quality, integrity and provenance. “Real tea isn’t cheap and dusty,
    stacked high in the supermarket. It’s truly beautiful. Steeped in ancient history. Our vision is for people to have
    the same love of handcrafted tea and as much respect for the artisan producers as they do in the tea-drinking
    cultures of Asia. Buying fresh tea directly from the farm is an important point of difference for Canton as many tea
    companies buy from wholesalers with general region and vague season. We know the provenance of every leaf we sell.
    Most of our teas are beyond organic; some are biodynamic, several are from tea farms abandoned many years ago with
    trees allowed to grow untamed; others are from wild native trees in the forests of Yunnan.”
