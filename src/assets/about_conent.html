  <p class="sub-heading">About</p>
  <p>
    Rosslyn was established in 2018 with the objective of removing some of the pomp associated with high-end coffee and
    replacing it instead with a simple, yet powerful, combination of friendly people serving exceptional drinks.

  </p>

  <p>
    Not concerned with trends, only what tastes good.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rosslyn is a coming together of hospitality styles from both Ireland and Australia, the homes of our founders James
    and Mat. “All the attention to detail and high standards of an Australian Cafe combined with the warmth and
    community of an Irish Pub brought together in a way that best serves modern day London”

  </p>
  <p>
    We couple this with who we believe to be the best producers across various fields, from The Estate Dairy milk to
    Mork Hot Chocolate and La Marzocco espresso machines... and of course...coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
    We make use of our experience and contacts within the global industry to bring to you some of the world’s best
    coffees from the industry’s leading roasters (often not available anywhere else) including the likes of Proud Mary
    (Melbourne), The Coffee Collective (Copenhagen), SEY (New York), Switch (Tokyo) and Origin (Cornwall).

  </p>
  <p>
    Prompt but never rushed. Humble, yet assured, and always with purpose.

    What’s in a name
  </p>
  <p>
    Rosslyn’s name originates from Rosslyn Street in West Melbourne, where James first learned to make coffee and a
    short drive from where Mat grew up. In Scottish Gaelic, ‘Ross’ translates to headland and pink, while ‘Lyn’ means
    waterfall. Hence, you will notice a lot of pink and cascading that runs through our imagery and branding.

    Our Founders

  </div>
  <p>
    James Hennebry and Mat Russell; hailing from Kilkenny, Ireland; and Melbourne, Australia respectively; have spent a
    number of years working across various fields of hospitality, including live music events with the likes of Live
    Nation, and helping to establish coffee programmes at some of the leading coffees shops and cafes in the UK. Having
    worked with prominent roasters in Australia such as Five Senses and Reverence, James and Mat first met at Caravan
    Coffee Roasters in London where they helped to develop one of Europe’s leading roasteries. Having spent a number of
    years advising various high-profile operators on their coffee programmes, James and Mat decided to take a punt and
    open their own little coffee shop on Queen Victoria Street in the centre of the City of London
