  Delivery days are Friday. All orders placed Saturday - Thursday, are sent out first-class by Royal Mail on that following Friday.

</p>
<p>Royal Mail are working as hard as they can to keep their service running smoothly, but the current unprecedented situation means they are experiencing some delays.
</p>
<p>During these challenging times, we are asking that you please wait 5 working days after your order has been shipped before contacting us about its whereabouts. We are finding that some packages are taking two days to arrive while others are taking a full 5 working days.
</p>
<p>The team here at Rosslyn are here for you and are ready to answer any queries you might have regarding your order. If you have any questions on equipment or brewing methods then send us them also and we will be happy to help where we can. Please e-mail hello@rosslyncoffee.com to get in-touch.
